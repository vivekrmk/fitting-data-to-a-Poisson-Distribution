# fitting-data-to-a-Poisson-Distribution


 The code in the function gofpoi(inputdata) fits the closest poisson distribution to your data set
 that you feed to the variable--> input data.
 For the closest fit, we make use of the MLE(Maximum Likelihood estimate) of poisson parameter.
 This goodness of fit function also reports the closesness to a poisson distribution with the pval,
 you can print it out if nessasary.
